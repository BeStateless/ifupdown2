- There is a state issue if multiple configuration blocks are present for the same interface in the interfaces file
- `ifquery -r` can give wrong result if dhclient is running + static addresses are configured
- `ifquery -r` status is success for success case and also for cases where there
is no support for query yet
- setup.py has ifupdown listed in data section instead of scripts: This is because default location for scripts is /usr/bin/. And ifupdown default location is /sbin. With newer versions we can specify --install-scripts directory. This needs to be fixed then.
- and more :)
